# Remove calls to Osclass

This part of the guide helps you remove all calls and requests to Osclass and Osclass Market.

This is the first and most important part of "Removing Market" guide.

Unlike the second part \("Remove Market from admin frontend"\), this one is a must, as it will stop your site from requesting data from Osclass Market.
